(ns channels.server.api.uri)

(comment "Ideally each resource NS would have a `uri` function, but that doesnâ€™t work
  because of cyclic load dependencies.")

; TODO: these could possibly be combined into a single function which would detemine
; which URI to build to which resource based on which params are passed in
; however I suspect that would make the calling code less clear
