# Channels Server

Server for Channels, hosting the API and mail servers

## Usage

FIXME

## To Do

* [ ] Implement DELETE for all “single” resources
* [ ] Sort discussions by most-recently-updated (i.e. most recent message)
* [ ] Look into why POST and DELETE requests, when sent to handlers which don’t implement those methods,
  return a 200 OK, instead of 405 Not Allowed
